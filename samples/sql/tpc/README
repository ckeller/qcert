For legal reasons we do not reproduce the TPC benchmark data here.  However, we provide instructions for obtaining the
queries that we used to produce our results for TPC-H and TPC-DS in our paper in SIGMOD 2017.

TPC-H:

1. Obtain the TPC-H tools zip from http://www.tpc.org/tpch/.  You will need to agree to terms which are
explained during the process.

2. Unzip the provided archive in a convenient place.  We are only able to explain how to build on a Linux
system.  Building on other systems is a bit of an art but can often be done (see the provided porting guide).

3. In the subdirectory 'dbgen', copy 'makefile.suite' to 'makefile' and edit the latter file to specify
 	CC      = gcc
  DATABASE= DB2
  MACHINE = LINUX
  WORKLOAD = TPCH

4.  Type 'make'.  It should build the needed software.

5.  Switch to the peer directory called 'queries' and make a subdirectory called 'data'.

6.  Source the file tpch_gens provided here.  It should populate the 'data' directory with sql files based on
the TPC-H templates.  Copy the sql files back to this folder.

TPC-DS:

1. Obtain the TPC-DS tools zip from http://www.tpc.org/tpcds/.  You will need to agree to terms which are
explained during the process.

2. Unzip the provided archive in a convenient place.  The supported systems are even more restricted than for
TPC-H.  We've only been able to build on Linux, which is how the makefile is set up initially.

3. In the subdirectory called 'tools' type 'make'.  It should build the needed software.

4. Move to the parent directory and make a subdirectory called data.

5.  Source file tpcds_gens provided here.  It should populate the 'data' directory with sql files based on the
TPC-DS templates.  Copy the sql files back to this folder.
