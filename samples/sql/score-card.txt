Do not parse: q1 ("(3)" on date condition), q15 (view definition)

Parse and compile: q2, q3, q4, q5, q6, q10, q11, q16, q17, q18, q19, q20, q21, q22

Missing:
  Support for 'left outer join': q13
  Support for 'cases': q12, q14
  Support for 'extract' (i.e., access date component): q7, q8, q9
  Support for 'like' (i.e., simple matching on a string): q2, q13, q14, q16, q20

Bugs:
  like operator isn't compiled properly: q2, q13, q14, q16, q20
  dates are treated like strings: (may affect most queries)

Usage notes:
  Use AliasAs (nested query in from): q7, q8, q9, q13, q21, q22
  Use isIn: q12, q16, q18, q19, q20, q22
  Use isBetween: q5, q19
  Use exists: q4, q21
  Use left outer join: q13
  Use cases: q12, q14
  Use deref: q7, q8, q21
  Use interval literal: q4, q5, q6, q10, q12, q14
  Use extract: q9
  Use like: q2, q13, q14, q16, q20
  Use substring: q22

Missing support proposals:

  Do not parse: q1 ("(3)" on date condition)

    Proposal: Remove "(3)" and pretend it's ok? (I couldn't find the semantics)

  Do not parse: q15 (view definition)
    Proposal: Small rewrite, which I believe to be equivalent and might(?) parse:

FROM:

create view revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) as
	select
		l_suppkey,
		sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
	from
		lineitem
	where
		l_shipdate >= date '1996-01-01'
		and l_shipdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '3' month
	group by
		l_suppkey;


TO:

create view revenue0 as
	select
		l_suppkey as supplier_no,
		sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as total_revenue
	from
		lineitem
	where
		l_shipdate >= date '1996-01-01'
		and l_shipdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '3' month
	group by
		l_suppkey;


  Support for 'left outer join': q13

  Proposal: like for group-by, use a left-outer-join macro, then
  adjust translation. Not efficient, but should provide the right
  semantics.

  Support for 'cases': q12, q14

```		select
			c_custkey,
			count(o_orderkey)
		from
			customer left outer join orders on
				c_custkey = o_custkey
				and o_comment not like '%special%requests%'
		group by
			c_custkey
```

  Add if-then-else to NRAEnv??? ouch... or maybe through either? To be
  investigated.

  Support for 'extract' (i.e., access date component): q9
  Support for 'substring' (i.e., access part of a string): q22

    Proposal: Need just to add the corresponding functions and check
    date/time and foreign types support works as expected. Josh
    already volunteered to look for 'simplest possible required js
    runtime for dates'.
