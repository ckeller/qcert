\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduced \NRAEnv, the Nested Relational Algebra with
Environments, which provides the foundation for a formally verified
query compiler written using the Coq proof assistant. \NRAEnv extends
a combinators-based nested relational algebra with explicit
environment support in a way that facilitates the specification and
verification of algebraic rewrites. A lifting theorem shows that all
existing NRA optimizations also apply to \NRAEnv. We showed how the
resulting compiler can be used for both traditional queries and for a
query DSL in the context of a rules language. 

Theorem proving techniques have greatly matured in recent years, and
we feel that their application to databases could prove useful in a number
of ways (for specification, prototyping, or to provide correctness
guarantees in scenarios where security or privacy are important). We
are currently working on further improvements to our compiler
infrastructure, notably to the optimizer and backend, in order to
support code-generation for distributed query plans.
