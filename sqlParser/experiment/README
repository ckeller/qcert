This is a rough set of notes allowing duplication of JSA's setup for experimenting with asterixDB instead of
presto as the SQL parser (ultimately, a SQL++ parser).

Note: nothing is automated yet.  Only an eclipse-based approach is currently supported.

1.  Clone the asterixDB repository from https://github.com/apache/asterixdb.git.  It is not necessary to do
this under eclipse nor do you initially import any projects into eclipse (this is done later with special
metadata). 

Currently I am using branch release-0.9.1.  I may switch to master if it becomes necessary to more
closely track updates or participate in the project.

2.  Do a full build as instructed in the "Build from Source" item in the README.md of that project.  This
requires Maven as listed there.  It's not necessary to start a server instance, unless you're curious.

3.  Edit your Preferences->Java->Build Path->Classpath Variables to include an entry for ASTERIXDB set to the
full path of where the top-level working directory of your asterixDB clone resides
(e.g. /Users/joshuaauerbach/git/asterixdb).

4.  From this directory copy files

asterix-common.classpath
asterix-common.project

to the new paths

$A/asterixdb/asterix-common/.classpath
$A/asterixdb/asterix-common/.project

(where $A denotes the full path to your asterixdb working directory).  

Yes, there are two 'asterixdb' folders in the final path after $A is expanded.  This is correct.

Then copy the files

asterix-lang-common.classpath
asterix-lang-common.project

to the new paths

$A/asterixdb/asterix-lang-common/.classpath
$A/asterixdb/asterix-lang-common/.project

and also copy the files

asterix-lang-sqlpp.classpath
asterix-lang-sqlpp.project

to the new paths

$A/asterixdb/asterix-lang-sqlpp/.classpath
$A/asterixdb/asterix-lang-sqlpp/.project

The asterixDB project is maven-based but supports Eclilpse development, therefore, these inserted files will
be git-ignored and will not dirty your asterixDB clone (in case you care).

5.  Use Import->Existing Projects into Workspace under Eclipse, to import (now) existing eclipse projects at
the three locations you updated in the previous step.  I recommend that you not request to copy the projects
into the workspace.  By importing them in place you permit further updates via get.

 You should now have projects asterix-common, asterix-lang-common, and asterix-lang-sqlpp, which should build 
 under eclipse with no errors (plenty of warnings though).

6.  Copy the file .classpath from this directory into its parent directory, replacing the .classpath that is
there.  This WILL dirty your qcert working directory, so you should take care to revert .classpath in the
parent directory before doing commits.

Note: I will create a better config eventually, perhaps using a branch or perhaps isolating new code in a
separate build and using a reflection barrier to choose dynamically between Presto and asterixDB.

7.  If you don't already have the parent directory (sqlParser) as an Eclipse projet, import it.  You may need
to import additional projects from qcert to allow it to build.  I am assuming you already ran the ant scripts
in the various Java projects to grab their dependencies, if not, you may need to do that also.
