Languages in Q*cert
-------------------

There are three kinds of languages: source language, target language
or intermediate language.

Source Languages
----------------

There are four source languages: LambdaNRA, SQL, OQL, and JRules.

For SQL and JRules, the parser is in Java and is called as an external
process.

Warning: Support for JRules isn't part of the open-source release, but
is documented here for completeness purposes.

Intermediate Languages
----------------------

All the Intermediate Languages (or 'IL') in Q*cert are:

Rule, CAMP, NRA, NRAEnv, NNRC, NNRCMR, CldMR, DNNRC

A few specific cases:

 - NRAEnv comes with a 'core' variant which is a subset of the 'full'
   NRAEnv but sufficient to express the whole. This isn't used in the
   default compilation path unless specified explicitely, but can be
   useful to simplify formal reasoning.

 - NNRC comes with a 'core' variant which is a subset of the 'full'
   NNRC but sufficient to express the whole. This isn't used in the
   default compilation path unless specified explicitely, but can be
   useful to simplify formal reasoning.

 - DNNRC comes with two variants: 'untyped' and 'typed annotated', the
   latter being used to drive code generation for Spark with Dataset
   support.

Target Languages
----------------

There are four target languages: JavaScript, Java, Cloudant and Spark.

In the case of Spark there are two variants: Spark over RDDs, and
Spark with Datasets.

Code Organization
-----------------

Every source language or 'IL' comes with its own AST, defined as a Coq
inductive type, and an evaluation function.

Every source language or 'IL' has its own directory in the Q*cert
code-base.

For every source language or 'IL', the Q*cert source code has a
corresponding directory whose organization contains at least:

  IL/ Lang/ (* Language definition, eval, eq, size etc *)

      ILRuntime.v (* All the modules for the IL runtime *)
      ILSystem.v  (* All the modules *)

Depending on the specific source language or 'IL', the corresponding
directory may also contain:

  IL/ Core/ (* IL core when there is a distinction i.e., for NNRC and NRAEnv *)
      Optim/ (* IL optimizer *)
      Context/ (* IL contextual equivalence -- that's for NRA and NRAEnv *)
      Typing/ (* IL typing for those we have a type system for *)

      ILTypes.v (* All the typing modules *)
      ILOptim.v (* All the optimizer modules *)

Language Naming Conventions
---------------------------

Every source language, target language or 'IL', along with their
variants, is uniquely identified by a name which can be used by the
user to specify the compilation path from the Q*cert command-line or
in the Web demo.

The full list of names is as follows:

Source languages:
   LambdaNRA   lambda_nra
   SQL	       sql
   OQL	       oql
   JRules      ????

Target Languages:
   JavaScript  js
   Java	       java
   Cloudant    cloudant
   Spark       spark
   	       spark2

'IL's:
   Rule        rule
   CAMP	       camp
   NRA	       nra
   NRAEnv      nraenv
   	       nraenv_core
   NNRC	       nnrc
   	       nnrc_core
   NNRCMR      nnrcmr
   CldMR       cldmr
   DNNRC       dnnrc
   	       dnnrc_typed
