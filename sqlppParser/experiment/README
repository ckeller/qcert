This is a rough set of notes allowing duplication of JSA's setup for experimenting with asterixDB instead of
presto as the SQL parser (ultimately, a SQL++ parser).

Note: nothing is automated yet.  Only an eclipse-based approach is currently supported.

1.  Clone the asterixDB repository from https://github.com/apache/asterixdb.git.  It is not necessary to do
this under eclipse nor do you initially import any projects into eclipse (this is done later with special
metadata). 

Currently I am using branch release-0.9.1.  I may switch to master if it becomes necessary to more
closely track updates or participate in the project.

2.  Do a full build as instructed in the "Build from Source" item in the README.md of that project.  This
requires Maven as listed there.  It's not necessary to start a server instance, unless you're curious.

3.  Edit your Preferences->Java->Build Path->Classpath Variables to include an entry for ASTERIXDB set to the
full path of where the top-level working directory of your asterixDB clone resides
(e.g. /Users/joshuaauerbach/git/asterixdb).

4.  From this directory copy files

asterix-common.classpath
asterix-common.project

to the new paths

$A/asterixdb/asterix-common/.classpath
$A/asterixdb/asterix-common/.project

(where $A denotes the full path to your asterixdb working directory).  

Yes, there are two 'asterixdb' folders in the final path after $A is expanded.  This is correct.

Then copy the files

asterix-lang-common.classpath
asterix-lang-common.project

to the new paths

$A/asterixdb/asterix-lang-common/.classpath
$A/asterixdb/asterix-lang-common/.project

and also copy the files

asterix-lang-sqlpp.classpath
asterix-lang-sqlpp.project

to the new paths

$A/asterixdb/asterix-lang-sqlpp/.classpath
$A/asterixdb/asterix-lang-sqlpp/.project

The asterixDB project is maven-based but supports Eclilpse development, therefore, these inserted files will
be git-ignored and will not dirty your asterixDB clone (in case you care).

5.  Use Import->Existing Projects into Workspace under Eclipse, to import (now) existing eclipse projects at
the three locations you updated in the previous step.  I recommend that you not request to copy the projects
into the workspace.  By importing them in place you permit further updates via git in the event that we are 
tracking asterixdb changes.

You should now have projects asterix-common, asterix-lang-common, and asterix-lang-sqlpp, which should build 
under eclipse with no errors (plenty of warnings though).

6.  If you don't already, import the parent of this directory (the folder sqlppParser) as an eclipse Java project.
Do not request to copy the project into the workspace.  The project should now build (if you had it earlier,
before creating the dependent projects, it would not have built).
