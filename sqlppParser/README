A Makefile is coming soon.  Right now, development is Eclipse-based.

To acquire the necessary dependencies as jars, simply run the getDependencies.xml Ant script.  Then, import
this project into Eclipse (indicate that it should NOT be copied into the workspace).

AsterixDB's Maven repository presence does not provide modular source attachments.  If you want to see the
source to the key dependencies, do the following steps.  The classpath of this project is already set up to
use the result.  The steps are optional and can be omitted if you aren't interested in the AsterixDB source.

1.  Clone the asterixDB repository from https://github.com/apache/asterixdb.git.  Use branch release-0.9.1 to
match the jars.

2.  In Eclipse preferences, go to General->Workspace->Linked Resources.  Check "Enable Linked Resources" if it
is not already checked.  Then, in the "Path Variables" section, select New and define the variable ASTERIXDB.
Specify as its value the location of the asterixdb subfolder of the working tree resulting from step 1.  As
the top folder is also called asterixdb, the result will be something like:

/Users/joshuaauerbach/git/asterixdb/asterixdb

3.  Refresh this project.
